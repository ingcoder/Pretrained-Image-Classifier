 This project was done as part of the Udacity pone degree program "AI Programming with Python"
 
 I used an already developed Python classifier to identify dog breeds. 
 
 The classifier uses a deep learning model (convolutional neural network, short CNN).
 
 The CNNs were trained on 1.2 million images from ImageNet. 
 
 I explored three different CNN architectures (AlexNet, VGG and ResNET) and determine which is best for the application.
 
 To determine the best algorithm (CNN architecture) I will measure the time it takes for the program to run and the 
 
 prediction accuracy.
