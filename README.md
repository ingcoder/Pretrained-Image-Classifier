 ## Description
This is a script to identify images of dog breeds using a pretrained classifier 
that was trained on 1.2 million images from ImageNet. 
The classifier uses three different deep learning models (convolutional neural network, short CNN):
- AlexNet 
- VGG16  
- ResNET18
The best model for the application will be determined by measuring performance time and prediction accuracy.
